Dog breed classifier using CNN transfer learning

This repository includes code for a dog breed classifier using transfer learning.

The notebook is structured in a few segments:
1. Building a human detector and a dog detector
2. Building a CNN from scratch for dog breed classification (accuracy: ~14%)
3. Using transfer learning to improve accuracy (accuracy: ~67%)
4. Testing the results

DenseNet-161 (pre-trained) model has been used for feature extraction using transfer learning.
